hey, i am Aditya Godse üçâ, an undergrad engineering student with a borderline software developer disorder and previously undignosed low-level system design obsession. Vaguely superstitious about flowers and AI.

i like to call this place classroom because this is the place I, as a software engineer, practiced coding. specifically, this is where i started learning about the programming languages theories and implementations domain. this place is my classroom, and I would like to share a part of it with you. here. 

I also consider myself a creative technologiest caring about many humanistic aspects (e.g. visual, sound, interaction) in UI.
