hey, i am Aditya Godse üçâ, an undergrad engineering student with a borderline software developer disorder and previously undignosed low-level system design obsession. vaguely superstitious about flowers and ai.

i like to call this place classroom. this is where i, as a software engineer practiced programming. specifically, this is where i started learning about the programming languages theories and implementations domain. i would like to share a part of my classroom with you.

i also consider myself a creative technologiest caring about many humanistic aspects (e.g. visual, sound, interaction) in UI. technology and design shall go hand in hand.
