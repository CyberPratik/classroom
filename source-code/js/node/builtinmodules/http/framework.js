//  A framework simply abstracts the lower level code 
//  allowing us to focus on the reqquirements than the code

//  For eg. Angular, react, Vue halps us build user interfaces 
//  without having to rely on lower level DOM API in JS

//  there are also modules to build web or mobukle applications
//  without having to rely on the http module in node js
